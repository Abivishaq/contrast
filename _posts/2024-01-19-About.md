I am pursuing a Master’s in Robotics at Georgia Tech, expecting to graduate in May 2025. I am currently part of the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning Lab under Prof. Sonia Chernova. My research focuses on explainability for proactive assistance, specifically for household robots. During my Master’s, I worked on an NSF-funded project exploring the cognitive benefits of conversational AI for older adults.

Prior to my Master’s, I worked as a Robotics Researcher at Zebu, a robotics company, for 1.5 years. My work included developing guidance algorithms for drones and fixed-wing aircraft for a drone interceptor application. In another project, I worked on locomotion gaits for an in-house-built quadruped robot and explored heterogeneous robot teaming between drones and quadrupeds.

During my undergraduate studies, I primarily focused on computer vision and embedded systems.  I also had the opportunity to intern at a startup working on drone delivery, where I served as the electronics lead for a team designing a package release mechanism. In addition, I interned with Prof. Wong Lai Kuan in the summer of 2019, working on image emotion recognition. During Summer of 2018 I interned at the National Remote Sensing Center under the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), where I contributed to bundle block adjustment for stitching multiple satellite images.

<!-- I am a master’s student in robotics at Georgia Tech with nearly two years of industry experience as a robotics researcher. My work spans topics like explainability for proactive assistance, learning from suboptimal demonstrations, and leveraging foundational models for robotics.

At Georgia Tech, I’ve worked with leading professors on projects like formalizing explainability for proactive assistance and investigating transfer learning for robotic skills. In industry, I contributed to autonomous quadruped systems and counter-drone UAVs, integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance functionality.

My research focuses on enabling robots to autonomously assist users and efficiently acquire new skills. I’m particularly excited about proactive assistance and generative skill chaining as pathways to advancing robot autonomy. -->

<!-- Hi! I am robotics graduate student at Georgia Tech. Working towards making robots part of our everyday life. My passion for  robotics stems from the potential impact that they carry. Plus, it is a fun field to work on. It's quite satisfying to see your code interact with the physical world. My expertise has been around the autonomy including associated components of perception and control. I have been work on field robotics: mobile manipulators, quadrupeds and UAVs. Presently I am a part of the RAIL lab, where I am working on the "Stretch Robot" from Hello Robot. Prior to my master I worked in a robotics startup called Zebu Intelligent Systems, where I contribute to 2 projects: Food delivery using a Quadruped and Counter UAV systems.  -->
