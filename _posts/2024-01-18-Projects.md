    In this work the grasping code base for the Fetch Robot platform was adopt to the Stretch robot platform. The overall systems objective is to return a  grasp pose for the object of interest. This was a part of a larger project where I worked with a team of 4 guided by 2 PhDs and supervised by Prof. Sonia Chernova.

    An agent is dropped in a finite 2d discrete world. It is given a goal position. The objective is to reach the goal position. There are certain blocked spots in the map to which the agent cannot move to. The agent has knowldge of the size of the 2d discrete world. It also knows its location on the map and the goal points location. It doesn't information on the blocked spots. However it can sense 1 unit around it and find blocked spots in this range. The agent can move top, down, left or right.

## Vulnerable Road User detection

This was my final year project for bachelor's degree. Utilized domain knowledge to add a preprocessing stage that allowed computation reduction of nearly half while maintaining performance.
